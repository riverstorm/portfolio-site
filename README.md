# portfolio-site

A very simple portfolio index page powered by Bootstrap 4 that was made as part of my Udacity course.<br>
It does not exceed the specifications, because there is an other personal portfolio following! :-)

There is no installation guide needed. <b>Simply download and open index.html placed within /src in your browser.</b><br>
To open a HTML file in your browser, the easiest way is to simply drag and drop it from a file explorer to an empty folder.
